<b> <h3> BACKGROUND </h3> </b> 
The COVID-19 pandemic has killed 3.2 million people and infected 150 million around the world as of April 30, 2021. Growing human rights concerns, vaccine movements, and skepticism towards the vaccines, its effects and efficacy have resulted in a multitude of conversations on social media and the process of vaccination becoming a complicated task. No major studies have been conducted to analyze peopleâ€™s perception of COVID-19 vaccines on social media for the year 2021

<b> <h3> OBJECTIVE </h3> </b>
<li> To extract information from tweets (between January and March, 2021) related to COVID vaccine where opinions are highly unstructured, heterogeneous and are either positive or negative, or neutral and identify driving factors for the change in sentiments </li> 
<li> To explore conversations and abstract "topics" that occur in the collected tweets using topic modeling and text analytics backed by breakthrough events in the timeline </li> 
<li> To visualize the trends in sentiments of Twitter users and popularity associated with the discovered topics </li> 


<b> <h3> DATA PRE-PROCESSING </h3></b>

<b> Data Cleaning </b> 

<li> Removed punctuation using remove_punct function with library re </li> 
<li> Removed URLs and emojis in Tokenization using library re </li> 
<li> Removed stopwords using nltk </li> 
<li> Lemmatization of Tweets using nltk.WordNetLemmatizer() </li> <br> 

<b> Individual vs Organizational Tweets </b> <br>
<li> Created a Bag-of-Words with ~175 keywords to filter on Display Names </li> 
<li> Removed 22% of the data </li> 
<li> 2,109,427 tweets remain after removing organizational accounts </li> 
<li> Assigned week numbers (1 to 12) to the dataset </li> 


<b> <h3> DATA MODELING </b> </h3>

<h4> Unsupervised LDA </h4>
To understand the abstract topics hidden in the tweets unsupervised LDA technique was implemented using the library 'pyLDAvis'. We discovered 18 different topics considering the cluster size and no overlapping amongst the clusters
<h4> Sentiment Analysis </h4>
Sentiment analysis is a supervised machine learning problem with different types of analysis. We considered a fine-grained sentiment classification with five levels of sentiments - overly positive, positive, neutral, negative, and overly negative. We used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) as a rule-based model to examine the impact of COVID-19 vaccine on the attitude of Twitter users during the pandemic. 
<h4> CorEx </h4>
Correlation Explanation (CorEx) provides a flexible framework for learning topics that are maximally informative about a corpus of text. Through anchor words, we seeded and guided the topic model towards topics of substantive interest, which allowed us to interact with and refine topics in a way that is not possible with traditional topic models. Normalized Topic Correlation (NTC) represents the correlations within an individual document explained by a particular topic.
