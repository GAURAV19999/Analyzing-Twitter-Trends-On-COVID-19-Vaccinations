<b> BACKGROUND </b> <br>
The COVID-19 pandemic has killed 3.2 million people and infected 150 million around the world as of April 30, 2021. Growing human rights concerns, vaccine movements, and skepticism towards the vaccines, its effects and efficacy have resulted in a multitude of conversations on social media and the process of vaccination becoming a complicated task. No major studies have been conducted to analyze peopleâ€™s perception of COVID-19 vaccines on social media for the year 2021

<b> OBJECTIVE </b> <br>

<li> To explore conversations and abstract "topics" that occur in the collected tweets using topic modeling and text analytics backed by breakthrough events in the timeline </li> 
<li> To visualize the trends in sentiments of Twitter users and popularity associated with the discovered topics </li>
